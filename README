INSPIRE git repository
----------------------

INSPIRE sources are to be installed after the Invenio sources.

You can customize some things in config-local.mk, for example on
Debian GNU/Linux, use:

   $ cat config-local.mk
   INSTALL = install -g www-data -m 775

To install a small INSPIRE demo site from scratch, you can use
for example `inspire-recreate-demo-site' helper devscript, see
instructions at:

   <https://github.com/tiborsimko/inspire-devscripts#inspire-recreate-demo-site>

You may be interested in having an RSS feed update a box on your homepage.
If so, edit feedboxes/inspire_update_feedboxes.py with a valid FEEDS list,
then install it somewhere and call it with the -d flag every ten minutes or
so.  It will rely on webcoll to regenerate the home page, so it's not really
sensible to run it more often than webcoll runs.
